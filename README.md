# Sorting-Methods-with-Python3
Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sorts

I wanted to make sure I understood these three sort methods, so I created a program that will allow you to choose one or all to sort some numbers. Additionally, if you choose all three sort methods, it gives you a summary of passes needed to complete sorts and swaps/inserts needed.

By default, the program will use a list of 15 random numbers. However, there is a menu for you to:
1. Create custom list of integers.
2. Use an already-sorted list of n numbers.
3. Use a reverse-sorted list of n numbers.
4. Use a list of n random numbers.
